## Hardware

**Be warned** - this whole section is a work in progress and likely wrong.

### Lead screws

- **(2) NEMA17 Stepper Motor w/ integrated lead screw 200mm T8x8**
- (10) m3x30  shcs (bottom z to motors)
- (2) m3x35 shcs (bottom z to rear motor z-chain)
- **(3) m5x16 shcs (ge5c)**
- **(3) m5 nut or nyloc**
- **(3) ge5c x 3**
- (9) m3x6 bhcs (ge5c retainers)
- (4) m3x12 bhcs (leadscrew nut, cut circle)
- (2) m3x14 bhcs + nut (leadscrew nut - rear, full circle)
- (4) m2x10 shcs + washers (to rail)

TBC - screws for accent plates

### Bed Assembly

- (3) m3x8 bhcs + nuts (fans)
- (2) m3x8 shcs + nuts (rear)
- (4) m3x10 shcs + nuts (left+right)

TBC - screws for accent plates

### AB Motors

Per motor:

- (4) m3x35 shcs (to motor)
- (2) m3x30 shcs + (2) m3x6x0.5 shim (short stack)
- **(5) f623rs + (10) m3x6x0.5 shim**
- (2) m3x40 shcs + nuts (to side extrusion)
- (1) mx3x10 + nut (under mount to side extrusion)

## AB Idlers

- (2) m3x6 bhcs + nuts (frame)
- (2) m3x10 shcs + nuts (tensioner)
- (2) m3x6x0.5 shim + (2) f623rs + m3x40 + nut (bearing stack)
- (1) m3x25 + heat set insert (tensioning arm)

***Warning:** This part is a real pain to assemble. I got lucky by re-using some of my v0 extrusions that have a hole in that location I could use a follower to construct the stack and the push the m3x40 through the tensionsing arm and bearing stack in one. The last part attaching the tensioner to the side face of the front. Good luck.*

## Frame

### 200mm extrusions

- (20) m2x10 bhcs (ends of 200mm extrusions)

### Rear

- (2) m3x8 shcs + nuts (middle rear to ab extrusion)

- (1) m3x10 shcs (rear extrusion to bottom extrusion)

### Bed

"usermod" carraige-slimmed.

- (2) m3x40 + nyloc
