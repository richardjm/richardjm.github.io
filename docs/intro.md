# Introduction

This site is an area where I can document what I'm doing or have done. If you
find anything of use to you please let me know.

If you want to [download and like my models on printables](https://www.printables.com/social/64622-richard-m/models) they give me filament,
which is nice.

## What's here?

- [3D Printing](3d-printing) - A jump off point to my models to download and print for yourself
- [CAD](cad) - There are some files I find useful when doing CAD designs without having to
lookup specifications each time.
- [Crucible](crucible) - My variant of the Crucible design which itself is a mod for the Voron 0.1.
- [Home Assistant](homeassistant) - Some configurations for home assistant I use.
- [Klipper in Home Assistant](klipper) - Connect to klipper directly without hacs from home assistant.
- [PixelIt](pixelit) - A nice little low-res display for clocks and messages and how I've integrated it into klipper.
